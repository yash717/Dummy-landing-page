# Dummy-landing-page


## Overview ðŸ“‹

1.created a dummy website for a Hacktoberfest event that allows students to make pull requests with interactive design.

2.HTML is the markup language used to create the structure of the website.
CSS is used to style the website and control the layout.
JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website, such as buttons, drop-down menus, and form validation.

3.We started by creating a basic layout for the website using HTML and CSS. Then, we then added interactive elements using JavaScript. It was important to make sure the website is easy to navigate and understand for students who are new to web development. Additionally, we created a clear guide for students on how to make pull requests on the website.
